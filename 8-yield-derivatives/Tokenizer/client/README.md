# Tokenizer

If you want you can interact with the Tokenizer already deployed in Stokenet by running this frontend in your local environment on your own machine.

The .env.staging file does contain the right addresses for you to play with the dApp as a standard user and with your own mobile wallet

You have to start the server by running 'npm run build' and then 'npm run dev' from this directory and then simply point your browser to localhost:5173

If you have a Staff or Admin badge in your wallet you can also config the dApp

    - point your browser to `localhost:5173/admin.html` 

    - config the dApp with your Admin or Staff Badge

This is particularly useful if you want to develop the front-end of an already deployed Scrypto component
